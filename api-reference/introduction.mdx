## Welcome

This REST API allows you to programmatically manage and interact with your Novacal account and its related data. All endpoints require authentication using Bearer tokens and return responses in JSON format.

Use this API to integrate Novacal's scheduling capabilities into your applications, automate event management, and build custom scheduling workflows.

## Base URL

All requests contain the following base URL:

```
https://api.novacal.io
```

## Rate Limits

The default maximum rate limit is 60 requests per minute per API key. After that, you'll hit the rate limit and receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response error code.

## Authentication

To authenticate you need to add an Authorization header with the contents of the header being `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` where `YOUR_API_KEY` is your API Key. You can generate and manage your API keys on the [API Keys settings page](https://app.novacal.io/settings/api-keys).

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```
